üé¨ Movie Data Loader

This module handles downloading and loading the MovieLens dataset.
It's designed to be beginner-friendly with lots of explanations!

What is MovieLens?
- MovieLens is a famous dataset used for recommendation systems
- It contains user ratings for movies, movie information, and user data
- Perfect for learning how recommendation systems work!

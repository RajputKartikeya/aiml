## 🎬 Demo Showcase Results

Successfully demonstrated all Phase 2 features:

### Basic vs Enhanced Explanations

**Basic Explanation:**

> "💡 We recommend 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' because users similar to you gave it high ratings. You have 68.8% similarity with users who loved this movie!"

**RAG-Enhanced Explanation:**

> "Our AI combines multiple signals to recommend this film. It matches your preference for Action, Adventure and is similar to movies you've enjoyed like films in your viewing history."

### Semantic Search Examples

- **Query**: "action adventure movies with heroes"
  - **Result**: Raiders of the Lost Ark (Score: 0.999)
- **Query**: "romantic comedies with happy endings"
  - **Result**: Forrest Gump (Score: 1.213)
- **Query**: "sci-fi movies about space exploration"
  - **Result**: Star Wars Episode IV (Score: 1.143)
